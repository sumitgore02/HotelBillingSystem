# HotelBillingSystem
This is a simple command-line Hotel Billing System Application designed to assist hotel managers. When a customer places an order, whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian, the manager can easily add those items to the cart. Once the customer requests the bill, the manager simply clicks on the "bill" option and provides the final bill to the customer.
